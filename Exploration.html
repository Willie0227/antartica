            <h2>Background Information</h2>
            <p>Lying in the Antarctic Circle that rings the southern part of the globe,
                Antarctica is the fifth largest continent. Its size varies through the seasons, as expanding sea
                ice along the coast nearly doubles the continent's size in the winter. Almost all of Antarctica
                is covered with ice; less than half a percent of the vast wilderness is ice-free.
            </p>

            <p>
                The continent is divided into two regions, known as East and West Antarctica. East Antarctica makes
                up two-thirds of the continent, and is about the size of Australia. Ice in this part of the
                continent averages 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) thick. West Antarctica, on the other hand, is a series
                of frozen islands stretching toward the southern tip of South America, forming an extension of the
                Andes Mountains. The two regions are separated by the Transantarctic Mountains, a range that
                stretches across the continent, and is sometimes completely covered by ice.

            <p>Despite all its ice, Antarctica is classified as a desert because so little moisture falls from the sky.
                The inner regions of the continent receive an average of 2 inches (50 millimeters) of precipitation —
                primarily in the form of snow — each year. To put that into perspective, much of the Sahara desert gets
                twice as much rain each year. The coastal regions of Antarctica receive more falling moisture, but still
                average only 8 inches (200 mm) annually. Unlike most desert regions, however, the moisture doesn't soak
                into the ground. Instead, the snow piles on top of itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although little moisture falls from the sky, Antarctica is still battered by colossal blizzards. Like
                sandstorms in the desert, the wind picks snow up from the ground and blows vast white blankets. Winds
                can reach up to 200 mph (320 km/h).
