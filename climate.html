            <h2>Climate Changes in Antarctica</h2>
            <p>Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have been rapidly melting. Human activities are at
                the root of this phenomenon. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide and other
                greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, even higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers
                are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea and retreating on land.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the worldâ€™s
                remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and
                thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone. Scientists project that if emissions continue to rise
                unchecked, the Arctic could be ice free in the summer as soon as the year 2040 as ocean and air
                temperatures continue to rise rapidly.
            </p>

            <h2>Effects of Ice Melting</h2>

                 alt="glaciers falling" class="exploring-img-right">
            <p>Melting glaciers add to rising sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and elevates storm
                surge as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent and intense coastal storms like
                hurricanes and typhoons. Specifically, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest
                contributors of global sea level rise. Right now, the Greenland ice sheet is disappearing four times
                faster than in 2003 and already contributes 20% of current sea level rise.
            </p>

            <p>
                How much and how quickly these Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt in the future will largely
                determine how much ocean levels rise in the future. If emissions continue to rise, the current rate of
                melting on the Greenland ice sheet is expected to double by the end of the century. Alarmingly, if all
                the ice on Greenland melted, it would raise global sea levels by 20 feet.

            <h2>Video Resources From National Geography</h2>
            <p>Here is a short video from National Geography that briefly discuss on the topic of Ice Melting happening
                in Antarctica. They want global citizen to be aware of the issues coming up with the glaciers melting.
                Join the Extreme Ice Survey (EIS) team on an expedition to South Georgia Island near the Antarctic
                Peninsula. This trip adds the Southern Hemisphere to a network of 43 time-lapse cameras placed worldwide
                on 24 glaciers. Capturing one photo per hour of daylight, the cameras placed on South Georgia will
                document the story of the island's melting glaciers.
