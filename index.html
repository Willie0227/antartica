    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <p>Antarctica is the coldest, windiest and driest continent. It contains 90 percent of all of the ice on Earth in an
        area just under 1.5 times the size of the United States. But the southernmost continent is much more than a big
        block of ice.

    <h2>Basic Information - Geography</h2>


    <p>The geography of Antarctica is dominated by its south polar location and, thus, by ice. The Antarctic continent,
        located in the Earth's southern hemisphere, is centered asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south
        of the Antarctic Circle. It is washed by the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean or, depending on definition, the
        southern Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. It has an area of more than 14 million kmÂ². <br><br>
        Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, the world's largest ice sheet and also its largest
        reservoir of fresh water. Averaging at least 1.6 km thick, the ice is so massive that it has depressed the
        continental bedrock in some areas more than 2.5 km below sea level; subglacial lakes of liquid water also occur
        (e.g., Lake Vostok). Ice shelves and rises populate the ice sheet on the periphery.
