            <h2>1. Seals</h2>
            <p>There are four types of seals that live in the waters surrounding Antarctica: leopard, crabeater, Weddell
                and southern elephant. All seals are fairly slow predators that hunt by waiting in places their prey is
                likely to appear. Most of them are unlikely to pay humans much mind at all - except for the leopard
                seal.
            </p>

            <p>
                This seal, named for its characteristic spots, has been known to become aggressive with humans in small
                boats. They're fierce predators and are perfectly happy to eat anything. Although they don't attack
                humans often, it's best to give leopard seals a wide berth.

                        Seals are found along most coasts and cold waters, but a majority of them live in the Arctic and
                        Antarctic waters. Harbor, ringed, ribbon, spotted and bearded seals, as well as northern fur
                        seals and Steller sea lions live in the Arctic region.

                        Fur seals feed on moderately-sized fish, birds (including penguins), squid and krill—with krill
                        making up the majority of the diet.

            <h2>2. Whales</h2>

            <p>During the summer, Antarctic waters are full of many different types of whales looking to eat fish,
                squid, penguins and plankton. Killers whales are one of the species travelers might be able to spot on
                their trip. These are the most aggressive and ambitious hunters, as their sights are set on seals, sea
                birds and other whales. They're perfectly capable of taking down creatures that are much larger than
                they are, provided they hunt in groups.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite being aggressive toward other wildlife, killer whales aren't known for attacking humans in
                nature. Some killer whales in captivity have attacked their trainers, but generally speaking, humans
                aren't at any particular risk around these creatures.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other whale species that travel south for the summer include humpback, orca and the largest animal on
                earth, the blue whale.

                        Whale Habitat and Distribution. Whales live only in water, and tend to stay where it is warmer.
                        This is why you will find them along the coasts during the winter months. They migrate to other
                        regions so they can keep their body temperatures high enough.

                        Massive swarms of krill, a tiny micro-shrimp in the Antarctic Ocean, provide the principal food
                        for blue whales – the largest animal that ever lived.

                        The heaviest caught in the Antarctic were a 9 metres (29.5 feet) female that weighed 10.4 metric
                        tons (11.5 short tons) and an 8.4 metres (27.6 feet) male that weighed 8.8 metric tons (9.7
                        short tons). At physical maturity, females average 8.9 metres (29.2 feet) and males 8.6 metres
                        (28.2 feet).

            <h2>3. Penguins</h2>
            <p>The world's favorite awkward Antarctic creature, penguins mostly eat krill and very small fish. They
                spend most of their time in the water, but usually come on land to mate and raise their chicks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although Antarctic penguins don't think of humans as a threat or a meal, it's still best to exercise
                caution when around them. They're not shy around people, and may come right up to you - still, they can
                and do bite, so it's wise to treat them the way you would any other wild animal.
            </p>

                        Penguins are usually found near nutrient-rich, cold-water currents that provide an abundant
                        supply of food. Different species thrive in varying climates, ranging from Galápagos penguins on
                        tropical islands at the equator to emperor penguins restricted to the pack ice and waters of
                        Antarctica.

                    <p class="item-p">
                        Penguins eat krill (a shrimp-like crustacean in the family Euphausiidae), squids, and fishes.
                        Various species of penguins have slightly different food preferences, which reduce competition
                        among species. (See Appendix for information on diet for each species.)

                        These penguins grow to 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.48 centimeters) tall and weigh only 2 to 3
